# QUEST UNLOCKED!
Congratulations, you've found one of the Zeemz PuzzleR pieces. A Zeemz Researcher was running through the Zeemz Labs, tripped, and papers flew everywhere. Obviously, upgrading to a tablet and IoT system would have saved our dear Researcher time and the poor tree's life. Whenever you find Zeemz PuzzleR pieces, you can either take the quest by creating a Pull Request OR you can open an Issue and offer comments/suggestions/feature requests. 
 
### Quest 

To accept the quest:
1. create a Pull Request and name it something like: "Kitty Vortex Landing Page Quest"
