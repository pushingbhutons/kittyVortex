    c. In addition to giving CryptoKitties access to the Kitty Vortex, cat superpowers are fueled by the stars. Kitties get special skillsets for their combined attributes, use these skills to make kickass equipment for your Zeemz characters. All kitties will be able to trigger the Kitty Vortex, if the address holder has at least 1 zSTAR. But, their powers will be linked to the unique combo of Kitty and Star attriubutes. So, 1 zSTAR will work with any kitty in the wallet and they will all have different powers.
