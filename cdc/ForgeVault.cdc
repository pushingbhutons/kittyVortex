// ForgeVault.cdc

// BEGIN NOTES
// The Forge Vault receives and holds items (equipment) & upgrades (stars) in long-term storage. 
//    - accepts 1 item (collar) and 1 upgrade (zStar) sent from Forge contract, user cannot send directly to Forge Vault
//    - only calls from Recycler can release items held in the Forge Vault
//    - only the address that owns the zCollar can call the Recycler to "decouple" the zCollar into collar and star
//            - zCollar is burnt
//            - charity option - don't burn the item, donate it to the drop system for random drops
//        - collar and star are returned to user account
//        - returned with random quality reflecting damgage from wear, tear, & recycling 
//            - ex. perfect (0.001% likely), damaged (item health 1-99.999%), destroyed (0.001% likely)) 
//            - recycled items will have reduced boosts and/or bonuses, higher likelihood of failing in battle games
// END NOTES
